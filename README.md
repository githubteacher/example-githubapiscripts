# GitHub API Example Scripts
This is a series of small shell and Ruby scripts that invoke basic functionality of the GitHub API.  These scripts are used in [GitHub Training classes](http://training.github.com).

## Running the scripts
When run, each script echos out what it is about to do, and then performs it, in almost all cases, unauthenticated. In a limited number of cases, a script may ask for a username and password which are then used in the demonstration.

## API Documentation
The full documentation for the GitHub API is [available here](http://developer.github.com).
